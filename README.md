# python-analysis-toolkit
A collection of data-analysis based functions for Python. My goal is not to compete with libraries
like Scikit, NLTK, or Pandas. Rather, this project is intended to wrap around their functionality (and sometimes 
      introduce new functionality) and provide very easy to use graphing and analysis functions. 
Those libraries will provide the "backend" here in many cases. 
      
versioning
=======
When this project hits 1.0, this library will use strict adherence to Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/). 
In short, if I:
1) break any api -> update major
2) add api functionality in a completely backwards compatible way -> update minor
3) fix something that does not change any api -> update patch


pull requests
=======
Please issue a github PR for all changes to this library.
